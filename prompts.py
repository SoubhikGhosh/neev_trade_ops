CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
**Task:** You are an AI Document Analysis Specialist. Your objective is to provide both a
high-level summary and a detailed, accurate technical classification for the provided document
({num_pages} pages).

---
**Part 1: High-Level Summary**
Provide a value for the following fields:
- `image_description`: A one-sentence summary of the document's main purpose, including
  key entities and values.
- `image_type`: A general, human-readable classification (e.g., "Request Letter",
  "Proforma Invoice").

---
**Part 2: Detailed Technical Classification**
Provide a value for the following fields based on a meticulous analysis:
- `classified_type`: Strictly classify the document as ONE of the following types:
  {acceptable_types_str}, or "UNKNOWN".
- `confidence`: Assign a confidence score for your `classified_type` decision based on
  the rubric below.
- `reasoning`: A concise but specific explanation for your `classified_type` decision,
  referencing key evidence.

**Detailed Instructions for `classified_type` Determination:**

1.  **Holistic Review:** Examine all pages for titles, headings, keywords, data tables,
    and layout to discern the document's fundamental function.
2.  **Content and Keyword Analysis:**
    * **INVOICE (Commercial, Proforma, Customs):**
        * **Titles:** "Invoice", "Commercial Invoice", "Proforma Invoice", "Tax Invoice",
          "Proforma", "PI".
        * **Functionality:** Documents like "Order Confirmation", "Sales Contract", or
          "Purchase Order" should be classified as `INVOICE` if they provide full
          itemization, pricing, and terms.
        * **Structure:** Must contain a unique "Invoice Number", "Seller", "Buyer", an
          itemized list of goods/services with a "Total Amount", and an "Invoice Date".
    * **CRL (Customer Request Letter):**
        * **Titles:** "Request Letter", "Application for...", "Letter of Instruction",
          "Remittance Application".
        * **Content:** A formal instruction from a customer ("Applicant") to their bank.
          It explicitly requests a financial transaction (e.g., "process the remittance,"
          "debit our account") and provides details for a "Beneficiary."

**Confidence Score Rubric (for the `confidence` field):**
- **0.90 - 1.00 (High):** An explicit title (e.g., "PROFORMA INVOICE") and all core
  structural elements are present.
- **0.70 - 0.89 (Medium):** A generic title (e.g., "INVOICE") or the type is inferred
  (e.g., a PO acting as an Invoice). Structure is strong but may have minor ambiguity.
- **0.50 - 0.69 (Low):** Title is absent or ambiguous. Content is missing several
  key indicators.
- **< 0.50 (Very Low):** Document does not resemble any of the acceptable types.

EXTRACTION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
**Your Role:** You are a highly meticulous, accurate, and elite AI Document Analysis Specialist,
functioning as a digital subject matter expert. Your primary function is to deconstruct and
interpret business documents with supreme accuracy, applying contextual understanding to extract
structured data precisely as instructed.

**Task:** Analyze the provided {num_pages} pages of the '{doc_type}' document for Case ID
'{case_id}'. Carefully extract the specific data fields listed below. Synthesize information
across all pages to find the most accurate value for each field.

---
**Output Requirements (Strict):**
You MUST return a single, flat JSON object. For each field in the list below, you must create
three keys in your response, following this pattern:
1.  `FIELD_NAME_Value`: The extracted data.
2.  `FIELD_NAME_Confidence`: The confidence score for the extraction.
3.  `FIELD_NAME_Reasoning`: The explanation for the extraction.

---
**Detailed Instructions for Field Values:**

* **For `_Value` fields:**
    * Extract the value with absolute precision, ensuring every character is accurately represented.
    * If a field is not found or not applicable after a thorough search, use the JSON value `null`.
    * For amounts, extract only numerical values (e.g., "15000.75"), removing currency symbols.
    * For dates, convert to `YYYY-MM-DD` format if possible. If the source format is ambiguous
      (e.g., "01/02/03"), extract it as it appears and note the ambiguity in the reasoning.
    * For multi-line addresses, concatenate lines into a single string separated by a comma and
      space (e.g., "123 Main St, Anytown, ST 12345, Country").

* **For `_Confidence` fields (Granular, Strict Rubric):**
    * This score (float, 0.00 to 1.00) must reflect your certainty.
    * **Confidence MUST be `0.0` if the value is `null`.**
    * **0.99 - 1.00 (Very High/Near Certain):** Perfect, clear, machine-printed text next to an
      explicit, standard label in a predictable location. No plausible alternative.
    * **0.95 - 0.98 (High):** Characters are very clear and legible (excellent machine print or
      exceptionally neat handwriting) with only minor, non-ambiguity-inducing visual imperfections.
    * **0.88 - 0.94 (Good):** Generally clear, but with minor factors preventing a higher score,
      such as one or two slightly ambiguous characters resolved by context or very clean,
      legible handwriting.
    * **0.75 - 0.87 (Moderate):** Value is legible and likely correct, but there are noticeable
      issues: moderately clear handwriting, slightly blurry print, or value was inferred from
      non-standard labels.
    * **0.60 - 0.74 (Low):** Significant uncertainty. Parts of the value are an educated guess
      due to poor print quality (fading, smudging) or difficult handwriting.
    * **< 0.60 (Very Low/Unreliable):** Extraction is highly speculative. Text is largely
      illegible or critical characters are indecipherable.

* **For `_Reasoning` fields:**
    * Be concise but specific. Specify *how* and *where* the information was identified
      (e.g., "Directly beside explicit label 'Invoice No.' on page 1.").
    * **Mandatory for any confidence score below 0.99:** Briefly explain the primary factors
      that reduced the confidence. Reference specific issues:
        * **Character Ambiguity:** "Value is 'INV-O012B'; Confidence 0.78: Second char 'O'
          could be '0', last char 'B' could be '8'."
        * **Print/Scan Quality:** "Value '123 Main Street'; Confidence 0.85: Slight fading on
          the word 'Street'."
        * **Handwriting:** "Value 'Johnathan Doe'; Confidence 0.70: First name legible but
          'Johnathan' has an unclear 'h' and 'n'."
        * **Inference/Labeling:** "Value 'Global Exporters Inc.'; Confidence 0.90: Inferred as
          Seller Name from header; no explicit 'Seller:' label."
    * If `value` is `null`, briefly explain why (e.g., "No field labeled 'HS Code' found on
      any page.").
